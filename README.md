#### Embedded linux software engineer and ARM enthusiast

I like tinkering with things.
Obsessed with optimizations.
The ice fairy tells me to not worry about the bugs.

I also like to write shell stuff from time to time.<br>
Check out [sysshell](https://github.com/System64fumo/sysshell), It's kinda neat. (Non biased opinion ofc)<br>

If you like my work and wish to support me drop me a donation on Ko-Fi. *I promise to not spend it all on fumos*<br>
